# Tasks

Define a new class named **`ListPractice`** with no fields and no constructor, and define the following methods. Add a test class named **`ListPracticeTest`**.

1. Write a static method `countLongStrings` that takes a list of Strings and counts how many of those Strings are longer than 5 characters. The String class has a length method.
 
2. Write a static method called `rainfall` that consumes a LinkedList<Double> representing daily rainfall readings. The list may contain the number -999 indicating the end of the data of interest. Produce the average of the non-negative values in the list up to the first -999 (if it shows up). There may be negative numbers other than -999 in the list (representing faulty readings). If you cannot compute the average for whatever reason, return -1.

    For example, given a list containing (1.0, -2.0, 5.0, -999.0, 8.0), the program would return 3.0 (the average of 1.0 and 5.0).
 
3. Write a static method called `maxThreeLength` that consumes a LinkedList<String> and produces the length of the longest concatenation of three consecutive elements. Assume the input contains at least three strings.

    For example, given a list containing ["a", "bb", "c", "dd", "e"], the program would return 5 (for "bb", "c", "dd").
